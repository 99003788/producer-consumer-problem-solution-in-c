# Multi Prodcuer-Consumer Problem Simulation
The producer-consumer problem is one of the classical examples of synchronization. This program simulates a multi producer-consumer problem in C++(althrough most part is c).

<b>Compiling the program:</b> g++ filename.cpp -pthread

<b>Running the program:</b> ./a.out number_of_producers number_of consumers
